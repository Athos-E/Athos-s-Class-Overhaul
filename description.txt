A change to how Terraria handles classes.


Changelogs
0.1.6
Mages? Wizards? Where?
I found out that the previous changes do magic armor didn't do the job... so I exchanged crit chance for raw damage.
-Removed critical strike chance bonuses from magic armor(including the ones from last patch) and added its previous values to magic damage.
-Above patch also affects Spectre chest, Nebula chest, Ancient Cobalt Armor and Jungle sets.
-All vanilla magic weapons(after this mod's changes) got +10 damage.
-4% reduced magic critical strike chance from every magic weapon in the game.
-Increased The Bee's Knees's damage to 31.

-Space Gun and Laser Rifle mana costs were reduced by 1 each.
-Razorpine mana cost reduced to 10.
-5 new prefixes exclusive to ranged damage mana weapons!
-Meteorite set's magic damage bonus reduced to 4% to each piece.

0.1
As of now, I'm trying to go for the basics, by editing vanilla stuff. This initial release is for Summon class changes.

-The Bee's Knees mana cost reduced to 5.
